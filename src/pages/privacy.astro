        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Chickadee Health ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS mobile application and services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Key Privacy Principle:</strong> Your health data stays on your device. We only store contact information on our servers to enable SMS notifications to your family members.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>Health Data Collection and Use</h2>
          <h3>What We Access from Apple HealthKit</h3>
          <p>
            Our app reads the following types of health data from Apple HealthKit with your explicit permission:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heart rate and heart rate variability</li>
            <li>Activity levels and step counts</li>
            <li>Sleep patterns and quality</li>
            <li>Walking speed and mobility metrics</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How We Use Your Health Data</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Important: We do not store your health data on our servers.</strong> All health data remains securely on your device within Apple's HealthKit. Our app analyzes your health data locally on your iPhone to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Detect patterns that may indicate increased fall risk or health concerns</li>
            <li>Send timely alerts to your designated family members when concerning patterns are identified</li>
            <li>Provide you with insights about your health trends within the app</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Your health data never leaves your device.</strong> We only transmit notifications to family members when the app detects concerning patterns. These notifications may include general health observations (like "sleep has been declining") but never contain specific measurements, exact numbers, or detailed health data.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>SMS Notifications</h2>
          <h3>How SMS Alerts Work</h3>
          <p>
            When you add family members to your health monitoring network, they will receive SMS text message alerts when our app detects concerning health patterns. These alerts may include general observations (such as "sleep has been declining" or "activity is lower than usual") but will not include specific measurements, exact numbers, or detailed health data. These alerts help your loved ones know when to check in with you.
          </p>

          <h3>Phone Number Privacy - Required Disclosure</h3>
          <p class="highlight">
            <strong>Your mobile phone information will not be sold or shared with third parties for promotional or marketing purposes.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            We collect and use phone numbers only to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Send health monitoring alerts to designated family members</li>
            <li>Send account and service-related notifications</li>
            <li>Verify user identity during account setup</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Family members can opt out of SMS alerts at any time by replying STOP to any message. Standard message and data rates may apply based on your mobile carrier's plan.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Security and What We Store</h2>
          <h3>What Information We Store on Our Servers</h3>
          <p>
            We store only the following contact information on our servers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your name and phone number</li>
            <li>Family members' names and phone numbers (for SMS notifications)</li>
            <li>Basic account information (email, account preferences)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>We do not store any health data on our servers.</strong> All health metrics, measurements, and patterns remain securely on your device within Apple HealthKit.
          </p>

          <h3>How We Protect Your Contact Information</h3>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your contact information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>All data is encrypted in transit using secure HTTPS connections</li>
            <li>Contact information is encrypted at rest on our servers</li>
            <li>We use secure, authenticated connections for all data transmission</li>
            <li>Access to your data is strictly limited to authorized systems needed to provide our SMS notification service</li>
            <li>We conduct regular security audits and updates</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>SMS Messages and Protected Health Information (PHI)</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do not send sensitive health data or measurements via SMS text messages. Our SMS alerts may include general health observations (such as "sleep has been declining" or "activity levels are lower than usual") but will never include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Specific health measurements or numeric values (heart rate, step counts, etc.)</li>
            <li>Medical diagnoses or conditions</li>
            <li>Detailed health metrics or data points</li>
            <li>Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by HIPAA</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            SMS messages are limited to high-level observations and alerts to notify family members when they should check in with you.
          </p>

          <h3>HIPAA Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Because we do not store health data on our servers, we are not a covered entity under HIPAA. Your health data remains on your device and is protected by Apple's HealthKit security framework. The contact information we store is handled with the highest standards of data security.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Deletion</h3>

            You can request deletion of your account and all associated contact information at any time by:

          <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
          <p>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Family members you designate:</strong> General health observations via SMS (such as "sleep has been declining") - never specific measurements or detailed health data</li>
            <li><strong>SMS service providers:</strong> Trusted partners who help us deliver SMS notifications, who only have access to phone numbers and the general notification messages we send, and who are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only for providing services to us</li>
            <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> When required by law, such as in response to valid legal processes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Your specific health data and measurements are never shared with anyone</strong> because they never leave your device. Only contact information and general health observations (without specific numbers or measurements) are transmitted to our servers for SMS delivery.
