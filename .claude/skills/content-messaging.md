# Content & Messaging Skill

Use this skill when writing copy for the Chickadee Labs / DeeDee static site.

## Core Messaging Principles

### 1. Plain English Always
Write as if explaining to someone who's never used a health app before. No medical terminology, no technical jargon.

**Translation Examples**:
- ‚ùå "Gait analysis" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Walking patterns"
- ‚ùå "Sleep efficiency metrics" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "How well you slept"
- ‚ùå "Cardiovascular monitoring" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Heart tracking"
- ‚ùå "Sedentary behavior reduction" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Moving more throughout the day"
- ‚ùå "HRV variability" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Energy levels"

### 2. Direct & Actionable
Every message should be immediately understandable and, when appropriate, suggest a clear action.

**Good Examples**:
- "Your heart rate looks good today"
- "Time to get moving"
- "You slept well last night"
- "Check on Mom‚Äîshe hasn't been active"

**Bad Examples**:
- "Cardiovascular metrics within acceptable parameters"
- "Consider increasing physical activity levels"
- "Sleep quality index: 85/100"

### 3. Conversational But Not Cutesy
Friendly and approachable, but serious about health. This is about caring for loved ones, not gamification.

**Tone Balance**:
- ‚úÖ "We'll let you know if something seems off"
- ‚ùå "We'll ping you if things get wonky! üéâ"
- ‚úÖ "Your family can check in anytime"
- ‚ùå "Fam can totally stalk your steps LOL"

## Content Structure

### Headlines
- **Short**: 5-8 words maximum
- **Clear benefit**: What does the user get?
- **Active voice**: "Monitor your health" not "Health can be monitored"

**Examples**:
- "Keep your family healthy and safe"
- "Peace of mind for loved ones"
- "Catch health issues before they're serious"

### Body Copy
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Scannable**: Use bullet points for lists
- **Front-load key info**: Most important point first
- **Minimum 20pt font size**: Remember senior accessibility

### Call-to-Action (CTA)
- **Specific**: "Download for iPhone" not "Get Started"
- **Benefit-focused**: "Try it free" not "Sign up"
- **1-3 words**: "Download now", "Learn more", "Contact us"

## Messaging Themes

### Family-Centered Care
DeeDee is about **proactive family health monitoring**. Emphasize the peace of mind for adult children caring for aging parents.

**Key Messages**:
- "Check in on Mom without being intrusive"
- "Get alerts before small issues become emergencies"
- "Your family's health, always in reach"
- "You're busy‚Äîwe'll keep watch"

### Trust Through Transparency
Users are trusting you with health data about their loved ones. Be clear about what you do and how it works.

**Key Messages**:

## Page-Specific Guidelines

### Homepage
- **Hero headline**: The single biggest benefit (peace of mind for families)
- **Sub-headline**: One sentence explaining how it works
- **Visual**: Show the app interface (red/yellow/green status)
- **CTA**: Primary = Download, Secondary = Learn More

### Features Page
- **5 core features**: Walking, Activity, Rest, Heart & Breathing, Energy
- **Icon + title + 1-2 sentences** for each
- **Real-world benefits**: "Catch mobility issues early" not "Track step count"

### How It Works
- **3-step process maximum**:
  1. Install the app
  2. Connect Apple Health
  3. Add your family members
- **Visual walkthrough**: Screenshots with brief captions
- **Address concerns**: "Your data stays on your device"

### Pricing
- **Simple tiers**: Free trial, then clear monthly/annual pricing
- **No hidden fees**: "No surprises, ever"
- **Value proposition**: "$X/month for peace of mind"

### Contact/Support
- **Empathetic tone**: "We're here to help"
- **Multiple channels**: Email, chat, phone (if available)
- **Response time**: Set clear expectations
- **FAQ**: Answer the 5 most common questions

## Voice & Tone Examples

### Reassuring (Primary Tone)
*Use when discussing health monitoring, alerts, family safety*

"We monitor the health signals that matter most. If something seems off, you'll know right away‚Äîgiving you time to act before small issues become big problems."

### Educational (Secondary Tone)
*Use when explaining how things work*

"DeeDee analyzes five key health areas: how much you're walking, your daily activity, how well you're sleeping, your heart rate and breathing, and your energy levels. Each area gets a simple status: green (good), yellow (check it out), or red (needs attention)."

### Empowering (Call to Action)
*Use for CTAs and conversion moments*

"Download DeeDee today and get peace of mind knowing your family's health is being watched‚Äîso you can focus on what matters most."

## Avoid These Patterns

### ‚ùå Medical Jargon
"Arrhythmia detection", "VO2 max", "Bradycardia alerts"

### ‚ùå Tech Speak
"Leveraging machine learning algorithms", "Cloud-based infrastructure", "API integration"

### ‚ùå Vague Benefits
"Improve wellness", "Optimize health", "Enhance lifestyle"

### ‚ùå Hype/Exaggeration
"Revolutionary AI", "Never worry again", "Miracle health solution"

### ‚ùå Cutesy/Silly
"Your health bestie", "Keepin' tabs on Grandma", "Heart goes brrr"

## Accessibility in Copy

### Reading Level
- **Target**: 8th grade reading level or lower
- **Tool**: Use Hemingway Editor to check
- **Sentence length**: Vary, but average 15-20 words

### Formatting
- **Headings**: Clear hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- **Lists**: Bullet points for easy scanning
- **Bold**: Key phrases for emphasis (sparingly)
- **Links**: Descriptive text ("Download for iPhone" not "click here")

### Alt Text
- **Descriptive**: "iPhone showing green health status for all five categories"
- **Context**: Explain what's important about the image
- **Length**: 10-20 words ideal

## SEO Considerations (Without Sacrificing Clarity)

### Keywords to Include Naturally
- "family health monitoring"
- "health alerts for elderly"
- "Apple Health tracker"
- "senior health app"
- "family caregiver app"

### Avoid Keyword Stuffing
Write for humans first. If keywords fit naturally, great. If not, skip them.

## Testing Your Copy

Ask yourself:
1. **Would my mom understand this?** (No medical background)
2. **Is the benefit clear in 5 seconds?**
3. **Can I read it out loud comfortably?**
4. **Does it sound like a real person talking?**
5. **Would I trust this if I were the user?**

If you answer "no" to any of these, revise.
